## 📡 Project Abstract
This project implements a random forest classifier to predict the spectral classification of stars based on their observed attributes. 

## 🧮 Model


## ⭐ Dataset

This project utilizes a six-class dataset, which articulates various star attributes that the application later extrapolates to use as training features for the random forest.
