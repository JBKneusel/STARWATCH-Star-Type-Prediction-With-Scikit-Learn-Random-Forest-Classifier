# Star-Type-Prediction-With-Scikit-Learn-Random-Forest-Classifier

![Alt Text](HRD.jpg)

## 📡 Project Abstract
This project implements a random forest classifier to predict the spectral classification of stars based on their observed attributes. 

## 🧮 Model


## ⭐ Dataset

This project utilizes a six-class dataset, which articulates various star attributes that the application later extrapolates to use as training features for the random forest.

These features are as follows:

```
- Absolute Temperature (in K)
- Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
- Relative Radius (R/Ro)
- Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
- Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
- Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
- Star Type (Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)
- Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
- Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
```
